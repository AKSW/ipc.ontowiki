# IPC OntoWiki Extension

Instant Picture Creator (IPC) is a wrapper to produce images on demand
for Web sites.

This extension implements an IPC proxy for remote images for OntoWiki.
After installation, URLs of the form  `OWBASE/ipc/get?url=...&filter=...` can
be used.

Note: Until the first release, I will rebase / change git history in this branch!!!
